      <em>
        A traditional, easy, and delicious Italian custard. It tastes just like
        the panna cotta served at Italian<br />
        restaurants. Serve with warm hot fudge sauce and fresh raspberries on
        top. This keeps well for several days <br />in the refrigerator.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>⅓ cup skim milk</li>
      <li>1 (.25 ounce) envelope unflavored gelatin</li>
      <li>2 ½ cups heavy cream</li>
      <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pour milk into a small bowl, and stir in the gelatin powder. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a saucepan, stir together the heavy cream and sugar, and set over
        medium heat. Bring to a full boil, watching<br />
        carefully, as the cream will quickly rise to the top of the pan. Pour
        the gelatin and milk into the cream, stirring until<br />
        completely dissolved. Cook for one minute, stirring constantly. Remove
        from heat, stir in the vanilla and pour<br />
        into six individual ramekin dishes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cool the ramekins uncovered at room temperature. When cool, cover with
        plastic<br />
        wrap, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, but preferably overnight
        before serving.
